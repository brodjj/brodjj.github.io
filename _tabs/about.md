I'm an aging Xennial who's been watching technology evolve (and occasionally devolve) since the days when "online" meant tying up the phone line and praying nobody tried to make a call.

My career has taken me through essential services, higher education, IT, and digital project management, which is a polite way of saying I've spent decades watching smart people make the same mistakes with new technologies over and over again. I've worked in energy and water (the stuff that keeps civilisation functioning when everything else falls apart), universities (where I discovered that institutional bureaucracy is its own form of artificial intelligence, minus the intelligence), and tech teams (where "move fast and break things" turned out to be less of a motto and more of a warning label).

This blog exists because I got tired of every AI conversation being either breathless hype from techbros who think ChatGPT is going to cure cancer by Thursday, or apocalyptic panic from people who watched Terminator 2 one too many times and took it as a documentary.

The goal is simple: look at what AI is actually doing right now, apply some critical thinking and existing frameworks, and have honest conversations about it. No clickbait doom. No starry-eyed utopianism. Just a realistic look at a technology that's already here and isn't going anywhere.

If you're expecting hot takes about the singularity or wide-eyed predictions about when AI will achieve consciousness, you're in the wrong place. If you want someone to explain AI developments like a slightly exasperated mate at the pub who happens to have opinions about both occupational health and safety law and 1990s DuckTales figurines, pull up a stool.
