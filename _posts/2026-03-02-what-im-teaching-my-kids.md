# What I'm Teaching My Kids About Living in a Post-AI World

_Low-tech tools. Still relevant._

There's a particular kind of parental panic that sets in when you're watching your kid navigate a touchscreen with the casual confidence of a seasoned UX researcher, while simultaneously being unable to tie their shoelaces. If you've got kids old enough to have opinions about screen time but still young enough to think Dad knows things, you've got a narrow window to teach them some life skills before some botoxed TikTok influencer does it for you.

The AI era is here, and it's accelerating faster than the plot of a late-season sci-fi show that's burned through its budget. (Looking at you, *Future Man*.) Whole categories of work are quietly mutating. Creative work, research, writing, coding, graphic design, customer service, legal research, accounting: all of it is being reshuffled. The kids being born now will navigate a professional landscape that would look completely alien to the average 90s kid who thought the height of technology was a graphing calculator loaded with a bootleg copy of *Tetris*.

And yet. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Humans are still going to need other humans. Things will still break. People will still make terrible decisions and need someone calm nearby who knows how to read a map. The core skill set for navigating life with any degree of competence hasn't fundamentally changed since your parents were nagging you about it. It's just now considered even more quaint and "retro."

I'm mediocre at roughly half of what follows. But even that mediocre level of competence has saved my arse more times than I care to admit. Consider this list less "parenting advice from an expert" and more "rambling wisdom from a bloke who learned several of these lessons the hard way, often in front of witnesses."

## 1. Creativity and design thinking

### Why it matters

AI can generate a competent first draft of almost anything. It can write, draw, compose, and produce content at a pace that would make a 1980s advertising agency blow their cocaine budget. What it can't do (at least not yet) is have a genuinely original idea. The kind of lateral, "what if we just tried something different" thinking that gave us the motorcycle, punk rock, and the mullet (two out of three of which were good ideas).

Creative thinking is how humans add value in an AI-assisted world. It's the ability to steer the machine somewhere interesting, rather than just asking it to reproduce something that already exists. The person who walks into a room with an interesting angle nobody else considered will always be more valuable than the person who can produce a competent version of what everyone else is already doing. AI has the competent version covered. Your kid needs to bring the interesting angle.

### What you can do now

Get your kid drawing as young as possible, and make it weird. Instead of colouring-in books, give them a stack of blank printer paper and some silly suggestions: "Draw a dog kennel made entirely out of things you can find in the kitchen," or "What would happen if a cat got into a mech suit and walked around the neighbourhood?" The second one will reveal whether your kid has the right instincts for this century.

Stock the house with cardboard, paper, sticky tape, and markers. Make little comics together. Design a board game from scratch. Make a flipbook of a stickman running so fast his shoes catch fire. Help them understand that boredom is a creative prompt, not a problem for screens to solve. The goal isn't to raise a graphic designer. It's to raise someone who, when faced with a constraint or a problem, asks "what if we did this completely differently?" rather than asking an AI for another spin on the same old thing.

## 2. Good ol' fashioned literacy and numeracy

### Why it matters

Before everyone gets comfortable outsourcing all writing to AI, consider this: the quality of what AI produces is almost entirely dependent on the quality of what you put in. Garbage in, garbage out. A principle that predates AI by several decades and applies with equal force to job applications, text messages, and (as several unfortunate American lawyers recently discovered) court filings.

A kid who can read well, write clearly, and do mental arithmetic without reaching for a calculator is a kid who can give precise instructions, spot when something's wrong, and make themselves understood under pressure. In a world where AI is doing a lot of the writing, the person who writes the best brief, prompt, or specification wins. That skill starts with being able to write a decent sentence, which starts earlier than you'd think.

### What you can do now

Read together early and often. Before bed, on weekends, on camping trips where the tablet has run out of battery and everyone is staring at the ceiling of a leaky tent wondering whose idea this was. When they're learning to write, make it fun: trace letters using colourful markers, try to recreate fonts from signs in your neighbourhood, show them how to write their name in the style of a heavy metal band logo (the illegibility is actually a feature, not a bug).

Get them involved in real-world number problems. "Your cousins are coming over Saturday. Each pizza has eight slices. If everyone has three slices each except Paddy, who'll take three but only eat two, how many pizzas do we need?" Give them a small budget at the shops and let them make actual decisions with it. These aren't maths lessons with a disguise on. Alright, they are maths lessons with a disguise on. But they actually work.

## 3. People skills

### Why it matters

No matter how automated the economy gets, humans will still need to talk to each other. Negotiate, persuade, comfort, crack a joke at exactly the right moment to defuse a situation heading somewhere bad. The ability to walk into a room, read it quickly, and communicate effectively is not something a chatbot will replace, because the humans in that room aren't interacting with a chatbot. They're interacting with each other, and they can tell the difference.

Employers, clients, colleagues, and everyone else will respond to people who can make them feel heard and occasionally make them laugh. Don't let your kid grow up to be the adult who communicates exclusively through reaction GIFs and can't make eye contact without a screen as a buffer. The iPad generation, with their Cheeto-dust-encrusted fingers and grunt-based communication, is a cliché for a reason. Don't let your kid become the cliché.

### What you can do now

Encourage your kid to ask questions, make observations, and share opinions out loud rather than retreating into a screen. Practise the art of conversation at dinner (actual conversation, not parallel scrolling). Get them comfortable talking to adults who aren't their parents: rellies, neighbours, the bloke at the deli counter. That's a muscle that atrophies fast in a generation raised on DMs, and it needs regular exercise to stay functional.

Help them hone their "tight five." Every adult should be able to get up at a birthday or a wedding and say something coherent and mildly funny without fainting or spewing down the front of their hired formalwear. Public speaking isn't glamorous, but neither is being the only adult in a crisis who can't calmly explain what's happening. The earlier they get comfortable with an audience, the better.

## 4. Making and fixing things

### Why it matters

Things break. They will always break. In the post-AI world, as in every world before it, there will be moments (far from a Bunnings, far from mobile coverage, possibly far from anyone with a trade qualification) when you just need to fix the thing yourself. The ability to diagnose a problem, find the right tool, and apply a bit of patient mechanical reasoning is genuinely useful in a way that no app can replicate.

There's also a confidence that comes from knowing you can handle your environment when it misbehaves. It's a different feeling from knowing your way around an app menu, and it matters more in the moments when things go wrong. You don't want your kid to be the adult who freaks out and lies down at the side of the road because they got a flat tyre and have no idea what a jack is.

### What you can do now

The next time you're fixing something around the house, bring the kid. Let them hand you tools, watch what you're doing, and ask annoying questions while you're trying to concentrate. Teach them the classics: "measure twice, cut once," "righty tighty, lefty loosey" (life advice that extends well beyond carpentry), and always wear eye and ear protection when sharp bits of metal are flying around, because eyes don't grow back and neither does your hearing.

Get them a little toolbox and add to it as they get older. Start with the basics: tape measure, pencil, a couple of screwdrivers, an adjustable spanner. Introduce a hammer and sharper tools once they've demonstrated the judgment not to use them recreationally on their sibling. At minimum, you want to raise an adult who can change a tyre, fix a leaky tap, and hang a shelf without jumping on Airtasker and paying three figures for a job that takes twenty minutes. Anything beyond that is a bonus.

## 5. Sports and outdoor skills

### Why it matters

Our caveman brains are wired to run, jump, throw things, and occasionally hit things with sticks. The post-AI world, however sophisticated, is not going to rewire several million years of biology. Physical competence (coordination, fitness, knowing how your body works under pressure) pays dividends across your whole life in ways that are hard to replicate by other means.

Sport also teaches things that are notoriously difficult to teach in any other context: losing gracefully, working as part of a group with a shared goal, and the particular discipline of doing hard things repeatedly until you actually get better at them. These are not skills AI will make redundant. If anything, they'll become more distinctive as everything else gets automated.

### What you can do now

Talk to your kid about what activities are available locally and encourage them to pick something and commit to it for at least a season. Team sports are great for social skills and the brutal education of shared failure. Individual sports like running, swimming, cycling, or martial arts are excellent for the self-discipline dimension, and have the added advantage of not requiring nine other people to show up on time on a cold Saturday morning.

If you're a certified nerd who spent every lunchtime in the computer lab and never voluntarily ran anywhere (I feel personally attacked by this paragraph), don't let your own sporting trauma become your kid's. Get outside with them. Walk, ride, kick a footy around badly. The point is to build the habit. Because at some point in your kid's life, there will be a situation (lost, off the grid, possibly in the dark, probably with mates who are slightly less useful) where the one person who can navigate by stars, read a map, or just keep walking calmly will be the hero. You want that to be your kid.

## 6. Digital literacy (the real kind)

### Why it matters

There's a difference between being able to use technology and understanding how it works. Your kid will grow up fluent in apps and interfaces, the same way your generation was fluent in VCR timers and six-disc CD changers (and by "fluent" I mean you could program the VCR but your parents couldn't, which made you a god for roughly three years until DVD players came along and ruined everything).

Real digital literacy is knowing what's happening under the hood: how files are structured, how networks talk to each other, how code tells a computer what to do, and how the platforms harvesting your attention are specifically designed to keep you scrolling.

In an AI-saturated world, the people who thrive will be the ones who know how to steer the tools, not just consume whatever the tools serve up. Understanding how technology works makes you infinitely better at working with AI, because you understand what it's doing, where it's likely to go wrong, and how to correct it. The future, as it's always been, belongs to people who learn the systems and know how to drive them towards their own goals rather than just riding along.

### What you can do now

Before your kid disappears down the standard social media and streaming pipeline, give them a different on-ramp to technology. Dig out an old laptop, install Linux on it together, and walk them through the basics: command line, file management, installing software, keeping things updated and secure. If you don't know how to do this yourself, that's fine. Do the tutorials alongside them. Kids learn a lot from watching adults learn things, especially things they find difficult. There's nothing more motivating for a ten-year-old than watching Dad swear at a terminal for forty-five minutes and then quietly triumph.

For an incentive that will get even the most sceptical kid interested in command line basics, tell them that once they've got the hang of it, they can install and play *Doom*. Nothing motivates a child to learn how to configure a firewall quite like the promise of shooting demons in the face afterwards. It also has the advantage of being historically accurate: a significant proportion of the world's sysadmins got their start exactly this way.

Graduate to small projects: a simple website in HTML and CSS, a basic script in Python that does something actually useful (or at least amusing). The indie web is surprisingly alive and well. Just as you might have built your first website on GeoCities in 1997, your kid could be building theirs on NeoCities in 2027. The tools have changed (kind of; Notepad has tabs now). The satisfaction of making something on the internet that is unambiguously, embarrassingly yours has not.

For the online privacy and safety dimension, track down [*Behind the Screens*](https://www.uqp.com.au/books/behind-the-screens) by Niraj Lal, which achieves the impressive feat of explaining surveillance capitalism and dopamine loops to kids in a way that doesn't require a postgraduate CS degree to get through.

## 7. Critical thinking

### Why it matters

Every generation has had to contend with misleading information, bad-faith arguments, and people trying to sell them things they don't need using logic they haven't examined. The AI era has simply upgraded the infrastructure for all of the above. The volume and sophistication of content designed to manipulate, persuade, and extract money or attention from your brain is only going in one direction, and it's not down.

A kid who can identify a logical fallacy, spot a motivated argument, and ask "why is this person telling me this?" is a kid who's going to be significantly harder to con, radicalise, or hustle. In a post-AI world where every second piece of content is either trying to sell you something or confirm a bias you already had, the ability to think clearly is essentially armour. It won't make you popular at family Christmas (nothing will, if you're doing it right), but it'll serve you well everywhere else.

### What you can do now

This is the skill where I'd most recommend deferring to actual experts rather than my admittedly patchy memory of second-year university philosophy, which I may have attended with varying degrees of sobriety and Winamp still running on the laptop. A few books worth tracking down: [*The Fallacy Detective*](https://www.amazon.com/Fallacy-Detective-Thirty-Eight-Recognize-Reasoning/dp/0974531596) is well-regarded for ages eleven to fifteen and doesn't assume prior knowledge. [*Logical Fallacies for Kids*](https://www.amazon.com/Logical-Fallacies-Kids-Reasoning-Arguments/dp/195393448X) by Quinn Voss covers similar territory. [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Book-Bad-Arguments/dp/1615192255) is short, visually engaging, and works well for younger or more reluctant readers.

In the meantime, practise "why" conversations at home. When your kid makes a claim, ask how they know. When they repeat something they heard, ask where it came from. Model the behaviour of changing your mind when you encounter better information (which sounds simple, but is rarer and more radical in practice than it has any right to be). The goal isn't to raise a cynical kid who trusts nothing. It's to raise a thoughtful kid who asks good questions before deciding what to trust.

## The point isn't to panic. It's to prepare.

Here's the thing about every major technological shift in living memory: the people who navigated it best weren't the ones who predicted the future correctly. They were the ones who showed up with a broad set of skills, a reasonable tolerance for ambiguity, and enough confidence in their own capabilities to adapt when the landscape changed. Basically, they were the IT guy from every office in the early 2000s who just kept figuring stuff out while everyone else stood around looking confused.

None of the above is exotic or expensive. It's drawing weird pictures and making things out of cardboard. It's reading together and involving your kid in the practical maths of everyday life. It's taking them outside and teaching them that boredom is just an unactivated creative brief. It's showing them how to use a screwdriver and a Linux terminal with roughly equal enthusiasm. It's building the habits of curiosity, resilience, and independent thought that have always been the difference between people who navigate the world on their own terms and people who get steered around by whatever system they happen to be embedded in at the time.

The AI tools your kids inherit will be extraordinary. Make sure they're the ones in the driver's seat.
